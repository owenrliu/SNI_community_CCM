Rows or columns that appear gray (NA, non-significant forecast skill) or very cool (blue-ish) in these plots indicate sites for each species that may not be appropriate to include, as their dynamics are not significantly cross-predictable.  A couple of things to notice:

* All species have high ($\rho$ >0.5) cross-predictability at some sites
* *Megastraea*'s dynamics at site 5 seem to be both unpredictable, and not useful for predicting other sites.
* *Pisaster* is difficult to forecast at sites 5 and 6
* There is some evidence that sites that are closest spatially (e.g., sites 2/3 and 4/5) have the most cross-predictability of dynamics, which makes sense.  This will not be examined further here, but worth noting.
