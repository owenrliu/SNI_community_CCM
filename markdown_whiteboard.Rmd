We now have a trove of new data: data describing interactions between species, interactions that vary with the state of ecosystem. In general, the multivariate models perform well (i.e. achieve good preditive power).

```{r multivariate model stats}
library(knitr)
t <- data.frame(spp=c(1,2,3),theta=c(3,4,5),rho=c(.89,.99,.32),mae=c(.4,.5,.6))
kable(t,col.names=c("Species","Nonlinearity", "Predictive Skill","MAE"),
      caption="Multivariate S-map Model Statistics, with nonlinearity, correlation of predictions with observations, and mean absolute error.")
